The libft project is a foundational exercise in developing your own library of C functions. The goal is to implement essential functions from the C standard library, such as string manipulation, memory management, and utility functions, while adhering to efficient coding practices and robust error handling. Throughout the project, you will gain a deeper understanding of low-level programming, including memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and algorithm optimization. By the end of the project, you will have created a personal library (libft) that can be reused in future projects, and you will have a stronger grasp of the inner workings of the C language and its standard library functions.
